 # Summary
 
 And finally, here's the destination of our journey.
 
 In this playground, we learn about five basic data structure, including `Array`, `Single Linked List`, `Stack`, `Queue` and `Binary Tree`. These basic data structures act as the foundation of the whole building of data structure, and they can be found almost everywhere if you continue your journey towards computer science.
 
 Although simple and naive, this playground shows what is data structure and how they work intuitively. If you have never learned data structure before, then this playground may be a good start to reveal the mystery of data structure. If you want to dive deeper or try to implement different data structures in code, you can go to more professional tutorials for help.
 
 **Anyway, thank you very much for spending you time on this playground!**
