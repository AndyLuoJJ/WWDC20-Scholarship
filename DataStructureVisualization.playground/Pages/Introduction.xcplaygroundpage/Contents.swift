 # Basic Data Structure Visualization
 
 Welcome to the world of *data structure*!
 
 In this playground, we are going to learn some basic data structures **without any code** but with graphics. If you have never learned about "data structure", this playground will be a good start before you dive into details on how to implement them.
 
 If you are interested in how to create data structures in code, you can refer to other tutorials. *This playground is only a simple illustration of how they work.*
 
 ## Why We Need Data Structure?
 
 In computer science, data structure serves as the foundation of other subjects. If you want to understand how operating systems work, you have to know data structure. If you want to learn powerful algorithms, data structure is a must. If you want to reveal the mystery of computer science, you cannot move on without the understanding of data structure. In a word, **data structure really matters**.
 
 Data structures are everywhere, not only in the field of computer science. You wait in a queue at the checkout counter when you finish shopping. You organize your files into a stack for later use. Having a better understanding of data structure may even be helpful in solving daily life problems!
 
 ## What Are We Going to See in This Playground?
 
 In this playground, we are going to have a look at five different sorts of basic data structures, including:
 1. Array
 2. Single Linked List
 3. Stack
 4. Queue
 5. Binary Tree
 
 To some extend, these basic data structures are closely related to one another, and once you can handle all of them, it will be much easier to understand advanced data structures and algorithms.
 
 Let's start our journey!
