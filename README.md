# WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge

This is my second time submitting for WWDC scholarship. I create a playground to display different kinds of data structures and try to visualize the process of manipulating them. The user can interact with the playground and try to add or remove data to see how it works.

I got this idea because I had been teaching myself data structures months before the submission. I think it would be convenient if I had a visualization tool to see how these data structures actually work.

The majority of this playground is written in SwiftU. However, the animation in the first page is written using traditional UIKit. I also regard this playground as an exercise to check my understanding of SwiftUI.

Unfortuantely, this playground lacked innovation and creativity, so I failed to win the scholarship this year. Hope I can do better next year!
